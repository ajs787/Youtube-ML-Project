## 🧠 **Model Development**
* For this project, each team member trained a different machine learning model to compare how well various algorithms could predict YouTube video virality. Our candidate models included Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, XGBoost, CatBoost, and SVM. All models followed the same preprocessing pipeline and were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. After running hyperparameter tuning and validating performance, the top three models were Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, which consistently delivered the strongest and most reliable results. These models were carried forward for deeper analysis in the results section.
