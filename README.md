## 🧠 **Model Development**
* For this project, each team member trained a different machine learning model to compare how well various algorithms could predict YouTube video virality. Our candidate models included Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, XGBoost, CatBoost, and SVM. All models followed the same preprocessing pipeline and were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. After running hyperparameter tuning and validating performance, the top three models were Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, which consistently delivered the strongest and most reliable results. These models were carried forward for deeper analysis in the results section.

## 📈 **Results & Key Findings**


* 🔍 Overall Model Performance

To predict whether a YouTube video would continue trending for 7+ days, I trained and compared several machine learning models. All models used the same preprocessing pipeline and were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

* Incorporate textual features (titles, descriptions, tags) using NLP methods to improve prediction performance.
* Expand the dataset to include all nine available regions to increase model generalizability.
* Enhance feature engineering with sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and keyword extraction.
* Build a simple dashboard or visualization for creators to test video attributes and see predicted virality.
